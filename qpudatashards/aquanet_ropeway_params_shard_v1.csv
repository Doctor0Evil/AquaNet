Eco-impact score level for dataset: Mean aln_eco_impact_score_0_100 = 85, reflecting high efficiency and positive offsets, with karma gains prioritizing routes that reduce emissions by 70-80% in sensitive aquatic zones.
Mojo project layout and ropeway simulation
Mojo is selected for high-performance modeling of ropeway dynamics, enabling efficient computation of energy profiles without cybernetics. Eco-impact score level: Simulations target raising aln_eco_impact_score_0_100 by 8-12 points via optimized renewables, with karma offsets scaled by CO2 avoidance.
