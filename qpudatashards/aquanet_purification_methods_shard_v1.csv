Eco-impact score level for dataset: Mean aln_eco_impact_score_0_100 = 90, reflecting high marine safety and positive offsets, with karma gains prioritizing methods that enhance biodiversity (e.g., phytoremediation boosts habitat restoration by 15-20%).
Mojo project layout and purification modeling
Mojo is selected as primary for high-performance numerical modeling of purification processes, enabling efficient simulation of water flow and contaminant reduction without cybernetics. Eco-impact score level: Simulations target raising aln_eco_impact_score_0_100 by 12-18 points via optimized parameters, with karma offsets scaled by efficiency gains.
